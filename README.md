##  Piscine 26 Days 📅

The 42 Piscine is an innovative and intensive program designed to provide participants with a unique learning experience, departing from traditional methods. Over 26 intensive days, participants, also known as Pisciners, immerse themselves in an immersive learning environment, dedicating 10 to 14 hours per day 🕑.

This program stands out for its peer-to-peer learning approach, encouraging collaboration and constant interaction. Participants engage in individual projects and group work, problem-solving skills, effective communication, and teamwork 🤝.

In addition to the programming focus, the Piscine also includes events dedicated to the development of interpersonal skills, known as Soft Skills, essential in the professional world. These events provide a more holistic understanding of professional development, complementing the technical skills acquired 🎤.

Pisciners delve deep into the universe of the C programming language, consolidating their technical skills. Additionally, quiz challenges are incorporated to test and reinforce the acquired knowledge, creating a challenging, funny, and stimulating atmosphere  🅲.
