##  Piscine 26 Days

The 42 Piscine is an innovative and intensive program designed to provide participants with a unique learning experience, departing from traditional methods. Over 26 intensive days, participants, also known as Pisciners, immerse themselves in an immersive learning environment, dedicating 10 to 14 hours per day.

This program stands out for its peer-to-peer learning approach, encouraging collaboration and constant interaction. Participants engage in individual projects and group work, problem-solving skills, effective communication, and teamwork.

In addition to the programming focus, the Piscine also includes events dedicated to the development of interpersonal skills, known as Soft Skills, essential in the professional world. These events provide a more holistic understanding of professional development, complementing the technical skills acquired.

Pisciners delve deep into the universe of the C programming language, consolidating their technical skills. Additionally, quiz challenges are incorporated to test and reinforce the acquired knowledge, creating a challenging, funny, and stimulating atmosphere.
